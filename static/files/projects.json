                "msg": "The global spread of the novel coronavirus is affected by the spread of related misinformation --- the so-called COVID-19 Infodemic --- that makes populations more vulnerable to the disease through resistance to mitigation efforts. In our <a href='https://doi.org/10.1177/20539517211013861' target='_blank'><i class='far fa-file-pdf'></i> paper</a> <b>The COVID-19 Infodemic: Twitter versus Facebook </b> we analyze the prevalence and diffusion of links to low-credibility content about the pandemic across two major social media platforms, Twitter and Facebook. We characterize cross-platform similarities and differences in popular sources, diffusion patterns, influencers, coordination, and automation. Comparing the two platforms, we find divergence among the prevalence of popular low-credibility sources and suspicious videos. A minority of accounts and pages exert a strong influence on each platform. These misinformation \"superspreaders\" are often associated with the low-credibility sources and tend to be verified by the platforms. On both platforms, there is evidence of coordinated sharing of Infodemic content. The overt nature of this manipulation points to the need for societal-level rather than in-house mitigation strategies. However, we highlight limits imposed by inconsistent data-access policies on our capability to study harmful manipulations of information ecosystems."

                "msg": "A growing body of evidence points to critical vulnerabilities of social media, such as the emergence of partisan echo chambers and the viral spread of misinformation. We show that these vulnerabilities are amplified by abusive behaviors associated with  so-called 'follow trains' on Twitter, in which long lists of like-minded accounts are mentioned for others to follow. In our recent <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.13691' target='_blank'><i class='far fa-file-pdf'></i> paper</a> <b>The Manufacture of Partisan Echo Chambers by Follow Train Abuse on Twitter</b>, we present the first systematic analysis of a large U.S. hyper-partisan train network. We observe an artificial inflation of influence: accounts heavily promoted by follow trains profit from a median six-fold increase in daily follower growth. This catalyzes the formation of highly clustered echo chambers, hierarchically organized around a dense core of active accounts. Train accounts also engage in other behaviors that violate platform policies: we find evidence of activity by inauthentic automated accounts and abnormal content deletion, as well as amplification of toxic content from low-credibility and conspiratorial sources. Some train accounts have been active for years, suggesting that platforms need to pay greater attention to this kind of abuse."

In our recent <a href='https://doi.org/10.1177/1461444820942744' target='_blank'><i class='far fa-file-pdf'></i> paper</a>, we examine the perceptions of bots with partisan personas by conducting an experiment with human subjects. Our analysis reveals asymmetrical partisan-motivated reasoning, in that conservative profiles appear to be more confusing and Republican participants perform less well in the recognition task. Moreover, Republican users are more likely to confuse conservative bots with humans, whereas Democratic users are more likely to confuse conservative human users with bots."
